Hassium is a programming language written in C# for the heck of it.
The syntax is a lot like C mixed with Python and it is very easy to
learn to program in it.

Hassium HelloWorldPrgm.hs:
```
print("Hello, World!");
```

In docs/Introduction.md There is a guide to Hassium that also doubles
as a guide to programming in general. It will show you how to get Hassium
set up on your system and running programs. It was written for the absolute
beginner and should answer most questions one could have about Hassium.

In Docs there are also multiple folders that contain code examples for
every single function in Hassium. These files within contain a comment
that explains what the program does and show the usage of functions.

Any other questions can be directed to myself at misiriansoft@gmail.com
or on irc.int0x10.com:6697 as Reagan.
