# Hassium

Hassium is a dynamic scripting programming language written in C#. The syntax is similar to Python, Ruby, and C#.
The language is easy to learn from the wiki, and the standard library has been documented in the docs/ folder included in the repo.

Hello World example:
```go
func main () {
    println ("Hello, World!");
}
```
