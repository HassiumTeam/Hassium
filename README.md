Hassium is a programming language written in C# for the heck of it.
The syntax is a lot like C mixed with Python and it is very easy to
learn to program in it.

Hassium HelloWorldPrgm.hs:
```
func main() {
	print("Hello, World!");
}
```

In Docs there are also multiple folders that contain code examples for
every single function in Hassium. These files within contain a comment
that explains what the program does and show the usage of functions.

Any other questions can be directed to myself at misiriansoft@gmail.com
or on irc.int0x10.com:6697 as Reagan.
